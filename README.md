The program attached is both the 'main program' and 'visualisation' in one program, they are not separate. Visualisation is achieved using Pygame and Matplotlib. Program was developed using IDLE on a desktop computer with Python, pip, Pygame and Matplotlib installed, so if one is having difficulty running program, that would be the most reliable setup. To emphasise, both the implementation and visualisation aspects of the assignment have been completed, they are simply not separated into different programs. Implementation of algorithms pertaining to actual data manipulaiton and calculation was achieved using regular Python functions and functionalities.

The purpose of the program is to manipulate and display data about the UK's forests in user-specified ways. ***Buttons will almost certainly have to be clicked more than once*** as their responsivity is lacking. Buttons may have to be clicked many times before working. Code is also given in a zip file in case of any problems running from GitHub
